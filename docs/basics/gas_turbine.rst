This tutorial introduces a new component, the combustion chamber. You will
learn how to use the component and set up a simple open cycle gas turbine: It
compresses air and burns fuel in the combustion chamber. The hot and
pressurized flue gas expands in the turbine, which drives the compressor and
the generator. You will also learn, how to use the fluid composition as a
variable in your simulation.

Setting up the Combustion Chamber
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We are setting up our system step by step. Especially for larger systems, it
is recommended you follow this approach, since TESPy highly relies on a set of
good starting values for good convergence. You can learn more about it in the
:ref:`advanced tutorial <tespy_tutorial_label>` section of the online
documentation.

.. note::

    There are two different types of combustion chambers available:

    - :py:class:`tespy.components.combustion.base.CombustionChamber` and
    - :py:class:`tespy.components.combustion.diabatic.DiabaticCombustionChamber`.

    Both can handle varying fluid compositions for the air and the fuel and
    calculate the fluid composition of the flue gas. Thus, it is possible to
    e.g. specify the oxygen mass fraction in the flue gas in a calculation.
    The difference between the components lies in the fact, that the
    :code:`CombustionChamber` does **not consider heat or pressure losses**,
    while :code:`DiabaticCombustionChamber` does so.

In this tutorial, we will use the
:py:class:`tespy.components.combustion.diabatic.DiabaticCombustionChamber`.
First, we set up a network and the components.

.. literalinclude:: /../tutorial/basics/gas_turbine.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [sec_1]
    :end-before: [sec_2]

In the first step, we do not connect the inlet of the combustion chamber with
the compressor but with the air source instead. Similarly, the outlet of the
combustion chamber is directly connected to the flue gas sink.

.. literalinclude:: /../tutorial/basics/gas_turbine.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [sec_2]
    :end-before: [sec_3]

There are many specifications possible. For the combustion chamber we will
specify its air to stoichiometric air ratio lamb and the thermal input
(:math:`LHV \cdot \dot{m}_{f}`).

Furthermore, we specify the efficiency :code:`eta` of the component, which
determines the heat loss as ratio of the thermal input. :code:`eta=1` means,
no heat losses, thus adiabatic behavior.

The pressure ratio :code:`pr` describes the ratio of the pressure at the
outlet to the pressure at **the inlet 1**. The pressure value at the inlet 2
is detached from the other pressure values, it must be a result of a different
parameter specification. In this example, we set it directly. Initially, we
assume adiabatic behavior :code:`eta=1` and no pressure losses :code:`pr=1`.

The ambient conditions as well as the fuel gas inlet temperature are defined
in the next step. The vectors for the air and the fuel gas composition have to
be specified using the individual fluids. The component can not handle `"Air"`
as input fluid. We can run the code after the specifications.

.. literalinclude:: /../tutorial/basics/gas_turbine.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [sec_3]
    :end-before: [sec_4]

Of course, you can change the parametrization in any desired way. For example
instead of stating the thermal input, you could choose any of the mass flows:

.. literalinclude:: /../tutorial/basics/gas_turbine.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [sec_4]
    :end-before: [sec_5]

or instead of the air to stoichiometric air ratio you could specify the flue
gas temperature.

.. literalinclude:: /../tutorial/basics/gas_turbine.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [sec_5]
    :end-before: [sec_6]

It is also possible to make modifications on the fluid composition, for
example, we can add hydrogen to the fuel mixture.

.. literalinclude:: /../tutorial/basics/gas_turbine.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [sec_6]
    :end-before: [sec_7]

The most convenient way to access the fluid composition is to access the
results dataframe for the connections.

.. literalinclude:: /../tutorial/basics/gas_turbine.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [sec_7]
    :end-before: [sec_8]

.. note::

    All component and connection results are available in the :code:`results`
    dict of the :code:`Network` instance. The keys of the dictionary are the
    respective class names.

Setting up the Full System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After learning more about the component, we are going to add the remaining
components: The turbine, the compressor and the generator. To do that, remove
the existing connections from the network, create the new connections and
add them to the network again. To represent the power flow between the turbine,
compressor, generator and the electricity grid, we can add instances of
:code:`PowerConnection`:

- a :code:`PowerBus` to represent a shaft (equates all energy inflows and
  outflows),
- a :code:`Generator` to model mechanical-electrical efficiency, e.g. 98 % and
- a :code:`PowerSink` analogously to the :code:`Sink` for material flows.

.. literalinclude:: /../tutorial/basics/gas_turbine.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [sec_8]
    :end-before: [sec_9]

Since we deleted the connection 2 and 3, all specifications for those
connections have to be added again. The air fluid composition is specified on
connection 1 with ambient pressure and temperature. The compressor pressure
ratio is set to 15 bar. Finally, set the gas turbine outlet pressure to ambient
pressure as well as the compressor's and turbine's efficiency. We start with
simulation which specifies a fixed value for the flue gas mass flow to generate
good starting values. After that, the turbine inlet temperature is set to
1200 Â°C.

.. literalinclude:: /../tutorial/basics/gas_turbine.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [sec_9]
    :end-before: [sec_10]

Note, that the pressure of the fuel is lower than the pressure of the air at the
combustion chamber as we did not change the pressure of connection 5. A
respective warning is printed after the calculation. We can fix it like so:

.. literalinclude:: /../tutorial/basics/gas_turbine.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [sec_10]
    :end-before: [sec_11]

We can investigate, how the turbine inlet temperature and the compressor
pressure ratio affect thermal efficiency and power generation. Also, we
assume 2 % heat losses and 3 % pressure losses in the combustion chamber.

Fluid Composition Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this section you will learn how the fluid composition can be used as a
variable in such systems. To begin, we can set the oxygen mass fraction on the
flue gas instead of the turbine inlet pressure, since it determines the share
of oxygen that is not required in the combustion. We can see, how the turbine
inlet temperature correlates with the oxygen mass fraction.

Let us now assume, we do have an unknown shares of hydrogen and methane within
our fuel mixture. With the known mass flow of the fuel and an overall thermal
input, we can calculate both fractions by removing their respective values
from the input parameters and using the :code:`fluid_balance` keyword instead,
which automatically calculates the sum of all fluid mass fractions to be 1.

Investigate how changing the thermal input requires a different mixture of
hydrogen and methane.

.. attention::

    With this setup, a thermal input below the lower heating value of methane
    or above the lower heating value of hydrogen (each multiplied with the
    mass flow of 1 kg/s) does not make sense as input specification. This is
    individual of every fluid you use as fuel, and you cannot easily abstract
    the values to any other combination.
