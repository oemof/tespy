If you need assistance or support there are several ways to get in touch:

User forum
==========
We have implemented a
`discussion room on GitHub <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/discussions>`__ as
user forum. If you have issues with setting up your model or any other question
about using the software, you are invited to start a discussion there.

Monthly online meeting
======================
There is a monthly online meeting for all TESPy users and developers. You are
invited to join us on **every 3rd Monday of a month at 17:00 CE(S)T** for a
casual get together. The intent of this meeting is to establish a more active
and well connected network of TESPy users and developers. You can bring your
challenges, questions and ideas and we will discuss them together or plan
potential follow-up meetings.

If you are interested, you can simply join the meeting at
https://meet.jit.si/tespy_user_meeting. We are looking forward to seeing you!
