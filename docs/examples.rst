    The streamlit dashboard *heatpumps* provides users with powerful tools for
    both design and part load simulation of a comprehensive library of heat
    pump topologies. Furthermore, TESPy's integration of CoolProp facilitates
    the use of a wide range of refrigerants. The exploration of simulation
    results is supported by fluprodia's state diagrams as well as the TESPy
    built-in exergy analysis feature. An assessment of the economic
    attractiveness of different heat pump setups is enabled through a
    component-based cost estimation. See the
    `GitHub repository <https://github.com/jfreissmann/heatpumps>`_ for more 
    information and if you would like to contribute.

      :target: https://github.com/fgasa/Integrated_CASE_Assessment

    A porous media energy storage is coupled with a power plant simulation.
    Yearly operation of different power plant and storage setups is optimized
    within different energy system scenarios in a first step by transferring
    information from the complex system to a mixed-integer linear formulation.
    The optimized storage dispatch is then passed to the coupled simulation to
    find actual mass flow rates as well as pressure subsurface distribution.

    An ORC power plant using two-phase geothermal sources is designed, and an
    optimization is carried out. The plant's performance is investigated for
    six different working fluids. Gross and net power output are optimized.
    The open source library pygmo :cite:`Biscani2020` is applied in combination
    with TESPy for the first time, setting the foundation for the optimization
    API of TESPy (:py:class:`tespy.tools.optimization.OptimizationProblem`).

      :target: https://github.com/fwitte/chp_orc

    Starting from well production information for a geothermal energy reservoir
    over a lifetime of 40 years, the development of the electrical power output
    of an ORC is monitored within different designs of the plant. The
    geothermal heat source is exploited to provide heat to a district heating
    system and the residual heat is used to operate the orc cycle.
