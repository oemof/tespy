Modeling Basic Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we will introduce how to create your first simple TESPy models.
In the intro part you learn about the modeling concept of TESPy. The other
subsections are step by step walkthroughs for well-known thermodynamic
applications.

If you want to learn more about the details of the different parts of the
software, you should also have a look at the
:ref:`Documentation section <modules_label>` after the first steps. If
you have any questions please reach out to the
:ref:`TESPy community <community_label>`. There are regular online
meetings as well as a discussion forum on GitHub.
