~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cards below link available university courses and teaching material
specifically for tespy or using it in the context of the topic.

.. note::

    These resources may not be up to date with the latest version of tespy at
    all times. If you want to help updating them, please reach out to the
    respective developers or open an issue on the tespy repository, so we can
    get things started.

    .. grid-item-card::  Model thermodynamic systems with tespy
        :link: https://github.com/IljaTuschy/tespy-znes-course/

        .. image:: /_static/images/thumbnails/educational/master_course_darkmode.svg
            :class: only-dark

        This is a complete master course with slides, exercises and
        documentation in the form of a script. The course is still under
        development and the script is not yet complete.

    .. grid-item-card::  Build component based systems at the example of a simple heat pump
        :link: https://fwitte.github.io/intro-to-thermal-engineering/

        .. image:: /_static/images/thumbnails/educational/intro_te_darkmode.svg
            :class: only-dark

        This introduces the fundamental concepts of component based
        thermodynamic modeling and three different solution approaches (at the)
        example of a heat pump. These are sequential and equation based models,
        and then how to model the same system using tespy.

    .. grid-item-card::  Simulate and analyse concentrating solar power systems
        :link: https://github.com/ddceruti/csp-exercises/

        .. image:: /_static/images/thumbnails/educational/solar.svg

        .. image:: /_static/images/thumbnails/educational/solar_darkmode.svg
            :class: only-dark

        This course is a short introduction to modeling concentrating solar
        power systems starting from solar irradiation calculations, considering
        different types of solar collectors and then using tespy to analyse
        Rankine cycles and supercritical CO\ :sub:`2` power cycles.

    .. grid-item-card::  Integrate thermodynamic models with economic dispatch assessment
        :link: https://oemof.github.io/heat-pump-tutorial/

        .. image:: /_static/images/thumbnails/educational/integrate_solph.svg

        .. image:: /_static/images/thumbnails/educational/integrate_solph_darkmode.svg
            :class: only-dark

        This workshop is an introduction how to connect thermodynamic modeling
        of a heat pump with a dispatch optimization problem.

    .. grid-item-card::  Introduction to exergy analysis
        :link: https://fwitte.github.io/TESPy_teaching_exergy/

        .. image:: /_static/images/thumbnails/educational/integrate_exergy.svg

        .. image:: /_static/images/thumbnails/educational/integrate_exergy_darkmode.svg
            :class: only-dark

        These resources show how exergy analysis works fundamentally and how it
        can be carried out automatically with tespy.
