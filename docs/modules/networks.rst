Networks
========
The network class handles preprocessing, solving and post-processing.
We will walk you through all the important steps.

Setup
-----
Network container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The TESPy network contains all data of your plant, which in terms of the
calculation is represented by a nonlinear system of equations. The system
variables of your TESPy network are a subset of the following:

* mass flow,
* pressure,
* enthalpy and
* the mass fractions of the fluids of every :code:`Connection` instance as well
  as
* energy flow (power or heat) for :code:`PowerConnection` instances and
* component variables (e.g. compressor rpm) if declared a variable.

The solver will simplify the variable space in a presolving step and then solve
for the remaining variables. In the following, you will find information on the
:code:`Network` setup, solving and debugging.

.. _tespy_units_label:

Unit specifications
+++++++++++++++++++
There are a couple of ways to impose boundary conditions with the respective
units to your models. The unit can be specified through two different ways:

- as default units per quantity (e.g. temperature, temperature difference,
  power, ...) for all properties of the components and connections, or
- as individual units of a specific parameter.

.. tip::

    TESPy implements :code:`pint` in the back-end to handle the units. If you
    want to learn more on how to work with :code:`pint` units, check out the
    respective `documentation <https://pint.readthedocs.io>`__.

The example below shows, how you can setup units for your :code:`Network`.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from tespy.networks import Network
    >>> nw = Network(iterinfo=False)

Default units are SI units. We can check, what unit is the default unit like
this:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> nw.units.get_default("temperature")
    'kelvin'
    >>> nw.units.get_default("power")
    'W'
    >>> nw.units.get_default("specific_volume")
    'm3/kg'

We can change the default units as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> nw.units.set_defaults(temperature="degC")  # celsius
    >>> nw.units.get_default("temperature")
    'degC'
    >>> nw.units.set_defaults(power="hp")  # horse power
    >>> nw.units.get_default("power")
    'hp'
    >>> nw.units.set_defaults(efficiency="%")  # percent
    >>> nw.units.set_defaults(pressure="bar")

The unit specification then applies to all parameters with the same quantity.
For example, let's set up a model of a compressor.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from tespy.components import Compressor, Source, Sink
    >>> from tespy.connections import Connection
    >>> source = Source("gas inflow")
    >>> compressor = Compressor("compressor")
    >>> sink = Sink("gas discharge")
    >>> c1 = Connection(source, "out1", compressor, "in1", label="c1")
    >>> c2 = Connection(compressor, "out1", sink, "in1", label="c2")
    >>> nw.add_conns(c1, c2)

Now we can parametrize our problem. It will utilize the unit specifications we
created above:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> c1.set_attr(fluid={"air": 1}, m=1, p=1, T=25)  # p in bar, T in celsius
    >>> c2.set_attr(p=3)
    >>> compressor.set_attr(eta_s=80)  # efficiency in %
    >>> nw.solve("design")

Now we can check results, e.g. the power of the compressor, which is expected
to be in horse power:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> round(compressor.P.val, 0)
    185.0

We can also retrieve the value with the respective unit, and then use pint to
transform it into what ever unit we need:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> round(compressor.P.val_with_unit, 0)
    <Quantity(185.0, 'horsepower')>
    >>> round(compressor.P.val_with_unit.to("kW"), 0)
    <Quantity(138.0, 'kilowatt')>

Alternatively, we can specify an individual unit using the :code:`Quantity`
class of pint. For that you have to utilize the :code:`UnitRegistry` of
your :code:`Network.units`: :code:`ureg`.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> ureg = nw.units.ureg
    >>> c1.set_attr(m=ureg.Quantity(1, "t/h"))
    >>> c1.m.val_with_unit
    <Quantity(1, 'metric_ton / hour')>

.. caution::

    If you now modify this number, it will remove the individual unit! On top,
    by specifying a bare number, you will always remove the unit information.
    This information is only reconnected once, the :code:`Network` is
    initialized in context of a simulation!

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> c1.set_attr(m=5)
        >>> c1.m.val_with_unit
        5

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> nw.solve("design")
        >>> c1.m.val_with_unit
        <Quantity(5, 'kilogram / second')>

To understand, what quantity is associated with a specific parameter, you can
do the following:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> compressor.dp.quantity
    'pressure'
    >>> c1.td_dew.quantity
    'temperature_difference'

Finally, it is also possible to use your own :code:`UnitRegistry`:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pint import UnitRegistry
    >>> ureg = UnitRegistry()
    >>> nw.units.set_ureg(ureg)

Changing the ureg will only have effect on future specifications. Existing
quantities are not changed.

.. _printout_logging_label:

Printouts and logging
+++++++++++++++++++++
TESPy comes with an inbuilt logger. If you want to keep track of
debugging-messages, general information, warnings or errors you should enable
the logger. At the beginning of your python script e.g. add the following
lines:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from tespy.tools import logger
    >>> import logging
    >>> ();logger.define_logging(
    ...     logpath="myloggings", log_the_path=True, log_the_version=True,
    ...     screen_level=logging.ERROR, file_level=logging.DEBUG
    ... );()  # +doctest: ELIPSIS
    (...)

The log-file will be saved to :code:`~/.tespy/log_files/` by default. All
available options are documented in the
:py:func:`API <tespy.tools.logger.define_logging>`.

Prior to solving the network there are options regarding the **console**
**printouts for the calculation progress**. Specify, if you want to enable or
disable convergence progress printouts:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> nw.iterinfo
    False

    # enable iteration information printout
    >>> nw.set_attr(iterinfo=True)
    >>> nw.iterinfo
    True

    # disable iteration information printout
    >>> nw.set_attr(iterinfo=False)

Adding connections
++++++++++++++++++
As seen in the introduction, you will have to create your networks from the
components and the connections between them. You can add connections directly
or via subsystems using the corresponding methods:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> nw.add_conns()
    >>> nw.add_subsystems()

.. note::

    You do not need to add the components to the network, as they are inherited
    via the added connections. After having set up your network and added all
    required elements, you can start the calculation.

There are two types of connections, you can learn about them more in
:ref:`these sections <tespy_modules_connections_label>`.

Start calculation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can start the solution process with the following line:

.. code-block:: python

    nw.solve(mode='design')

This starts the initialisation of your network and proceeds to its calculation.
The specification of the **calculation mode is mandatory**, This is the list of
available keywords:

- :code:`mode` is the calculation mode (:code:`'design'`-calculation or
  :code:`'offdesign'`-calculation).
- :code:`init_path` is the path to the network folder you want to use for
  initialisation.
- :code:`design_path` is the path to the network folder which holds the
  information of your plant's design point.
- :code:`max_iter` is the maximum amount of iterations performed by the
  solver.
- :code:`min_iter` is the minimum amount of iterations before a solution can
  be accepted (given the convergence criterion is satisfied).
- :code:`init_only` stop after initialisation (True/False).
- :code:`init_previous` use starting values from previous simulation
  (True/False).
- :code:`use_cuda` use cuda instead of numpy for matrix inversion, speeds up
  simulation in some cases by outsourcing calculation to graphics card. For
  more information please visit the
  `cupy documentation <https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/index.html>`_.

There are two calculation modes available (:code:`'design'` and
:code:`'offdesign'`), which are explained in the subsections below. If you
choose :code:`offdesign` as calculation mode the specification of a
:code:`design_path` is mandatory.

The usage of an initialisation path is always optional but highly recommended,
as the convergence of the solution process will be improved, if you provide
good starting values. If you do not specify an :code:`init_path`, the
initialisation from saved results will be skipped.
:code:`init_only=True` usually is used for debugging. Or, you could use this
feature to export a not solved network, if you want to do the parametrisation
in .csv-files rather than your python script.

The :code:`init_previous` parameter can be used in design and offdesign
calculations and works very similar to specifying an :code:`init_path`.
In contrast, starting values are taken from the previous calculation. Specifying
the :code:`init_path` overwrites :code:`init_previous`.

Design mode
+++++++++++
The design mode is used to design your system and is always the first
calculation of your plant. **The offdesign calculation is always based on a**
**design calculation!** Obviously as you are designing the plant the way you
want, you are flexible to choose the parameters to specify. However, you can
not specify parameters that are based on a design case, as for example the
isentropic efficiency characteristic function of a turbine or a pump.
Specifying a value for the efficiency is of course possible.

Offdesign mode
++++++++++++++
The offdesign mode is used to **calculate the performance of your plant, if**
**parameters deviate from the plant's design point**. This can be partload
operation, operation at different temperature or pressure levels etc.. Thus,
before starting an offdesign calculation you have to design your plant first.
By stating :code:`'offdesign'` as calculation mode, **components and**
**connections will switch to the offdesign mode.** This means that all
parameters provided as design parameters will be unset and all parameters
provided as offdesign parameters will be set instead. You can specify a
connection's or component's (off-)design parameters using the
:code:`set_attr` method.

For example, for a condenser you would usually design it to a maximum terminal
temperature difference, in offdesign the heat transfer coefficient is selected.
The heat transfer coefficient is calculated in the preprocessing of the
offdesign case based on the results from the design-case. Of course, this
applies to all other parameters in the same way. Also, the pressure drop is a
result of the geometry for the offdesign case, thus we swap the pressure ratios
with zeta values.

.. code-block:: python

    mycomponent.set_attr(
        design=['ttd_u', 'pr1', 'pr2'], offdesign=['kA', 'zeta1', 'zeta2']
    )

.. note::

    Some parameters come with characteristic functions based on the design case
    properties. This means, that e.g. the isentropic efficiency of a turbine
    is calculated as function of the actual mass flow to design mass flow
    ratio. You can provide your own (measured) data or use the already existing
    data from TESPy. All standard characteristic functions are available at
    :ref:`tespy_data_label`.

For connections it works in the same way, e.g. write

.. code-block:: python

    myconnection.set_attr(design=['h'], offdesign=['T'])

if you want to replace the enthalpy with the temperature for your offdesign.
The temperature is a result of the design calculation and that value is then
used for the offdesign calculation in this example.

To solve your offdesign calculation, use:

.. code-block:: python

    nw.solve(mode='offdesign', design_path='path/to/designpoint.json')

Solving
-------
A TESPy network can be represented as a linear system of nonlinear equations,
consequently the solution is obtained with numerical methods. TESPy uses the
n-dimensional Newton-Raphson method to find the system's solution, which may
only be found, if the network is parameterized correctly. **The number of**
**variables n changes depending on your system's topology and your**
**specifications**. On top of that, the presolver reduces the number of
variables based on your model structure and your specifications.

**General preprocessing**

* check network consistency and initialise components (if network topology is
  changed to a prior calculation only).
* create a topology representation of the components and the connections.
* simplify the variable space based on the plant's topology and your
  specifications.
* perform design/offdesign switch (for offdesign calculations only).
* preprocessing of offdesign case using the information from the
  :code:`design_path` argument.
* precalculate variables in case they can directly be determined from the
  combination of your specifications.

The topology check is used to find errors in the network topology, the
calculation can not start without a successful check. The design/offdesign
switch is described in the network setup section. For offdesign calculation the
:code:`design_path` argument is required. The design point information is
extracted from that path in preprocessing. For this, you will need to save
your network's design point information using:

.. code-block:: python

    nw.save('path/for/savestate')

**Simplifying the variable space**

To reduce the size of the system of equations a reduction of the variable space
is performed in the initialisation of a calculation. For every of the primary
variables (mass flow, pressure, enthalpy and fluid mass fractions), if a value
is directly specified by the user, the respective variable is removed from the
variable space, because it does not need to be solved.

Furthermore, three steps to simplify the variable space are performed, i.e.

- searching for linear dependencies between pairs of variables in the system,
- simplifying the fluid vectors and
- presolving pressure and enthalpy.

First, some of the components' equations return information in pairwise linear
dependency between variables. These are, for example,

- equality of mass flow or fluid composition at inlet and outlet
- equality of pressure at inlet and each of the outlets as in a spliiter
  component
- constant ratio of inlet and outlet pressure through a specified pressure
  ratio value
- linear dependency between two variables imposed be the :code:`Ref`
  specification
- and many more

These linear dependencies are used to build a graph, which then determines a
mapping from the physical problem to the mathematical problem indicating which
variables are represented by a single one. I.e.

- which mass flows are the same or directly linear dependent
- which pressures are the same or directly linear dependent,
- which enthalpies are the same or directly linear dependent and
- which fluid compositions are identical.

For example, in a simple Clausius Rankine cycle there will only be a single
mass flow in the variable space. The process is applied analogously for all
other variables, and may depend on the individual components implemented in the
respective model. For example, if a mass flow is split in two streams using a
splitter, the fluid composition remains constant downstream of the splitter,
while mass flow will not. Therefore, all connections downstream of the splitter
share the same fluid composition as upstream of the splitter.

The next step is a reduction of the fluid vector specifications: Consider a
case with a couple of potential fluids on a fluid branch, e.g. oxygen,
nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide and water at the outlet of a combustion
chamber. All fluid mass fractions specified by the user will be fixed and
removed from the variable space. If then, only a single fluid remains with
"unknown" mass fraction, we can assign a mass fraction to that fluid, which is
equal to 1 minus the sum of all other fluids' mass fractions.

Finally, presolving is applied to pressure and enthalpy, whenever the fluid
composition is fixed. If either pressure or enthalpy is specified by the user
and on top of that temperature, vapor quality or temperature difference to
saturation temperature, the respective variable (enthalpy or pressure) can
directly be calculated. Similarly, if temperature and temperature difference to
saturation temperature or vapor quality are specified, both pressure and
enthalpy can be deducted.

**Finding starting values**

The algorithm requires starting values for all variables of the system, thus an
initialisation of the system is run prior to calculating the solution. **High**
**quality initial values are crucial for convergence speed and stability**, bad
starting values might lead to instability and diverging calculation can be the
result. The following steps are performed in finding starting values:

* fluid composition guessing.
* fluid property initialisation.
* initialisation from previous simulation run (:code:`init_previous`).
* initialisation from .csv (setting starting values from :code:`init_path`
  argument).

Starting value generation for your calculations starts with the fluid
composition guessing in case the fluid composition is not fixed. The available
fluids will be assigned the same mass fraction :math:`x`, if no starting value
is supplied. The mass fractions are distributed to 1 minus the sum of all user
specified mass fractions: :math:`x=\frac{1-\sum\text{x_spec}}{n}`. If you are
using combustion chambers these will be replaced by a generic flue gas
composition will be calculated prior to the propagation.

Next the fluid property initialisation uses user specified starting values or
the results from the previous simulation to set starting values for mass flow,
pressure and enthalpy. Otherwise, generic starting values are generated on basis
of which components a connection is linked to. If you **do not want** to use the
results of a previous calculation, you need to specify
:code:`init_previous=False` on the :code:`Network.solve` method call.

Last step in starting value generation is the initialisation from a saved
network state. In order to initialise your calculation with this method, you
need to provide the path to the saved network in the :code:`init_path` argument
of the `solve` method. TESPy searches through the connections.csv file. If a
connection with the respective label is found, the starting values for the
system variables are taken over from that file.

.. note::

    The files do not need to contain all connections of your network. You can
    build your network step by step and initialise the existing parts of your
    network from the :code:`init_path`. Be aware that a change within the fluid
    vector does not allow this practice! If you plan to use additional fluids
    in parts of the network you have not touched until now, you will need to
    state all fluids from the beginning.

Algorithm
^^^^^^^^^
In this section we will give you an introduction to the solving algorithm
implemented.

Newton-Raphson method
+++++++++++++++++++++
The Newton-Raphson method requires the calculation of residual values for the
equations and of the partial derivatives to all system variables (Jacobian
matrix). In the next step the matrix is inverted and multiplied with the
residual vector to calculate the increment for the system variables. This
process is repeated until every equation's result in the system is "correct",
thus the residual values are smaller than a specified error tolerance. All
equations are of the same structure:

.. math::

    0 = \text{expression}

calculate the residuals

.. math::

    f(\vec{x}_i)

Jacobian matrix J

.. math::

    J(\vec{x})=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
    \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2} &
    \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\
    \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_2} &
    \cdots & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_n} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_2} &
    \cdots & \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_n}
    \end{array}\right)

derive the increment

.. math::

    \vec{x}_{i+1}=\vec{x}_i-J(\vec{x}_i)^{-1}\cdot f(\vec{x}_i)

while

.. math::

    ||f(\vec{x}_i)|| > \epsilon

.. note::

    You have to provide the exact amount of required parameters (neither less
    nor more) and the parametrisation must not lead to linear dependencies.
    Each parameter you set for a connection will add one equation to your
    system. On top, each component provides a different amount of basic
    equations plus the equations provided by your component specification.

For example, consider a pump: Total mass flow as well as the fluid mass
fractions of the mixture entering the pump will be identical at the outlet. The
pump delivers two mandatory equations. If you additionally specify, e.g. the
power :math:`P` to be 1000 W, the set of equations will look like this:

.. math::

    \forall i \in \mathrm{network.fluids} \, &0 = fluid_{i,in} -fluid_{i,out}\\
    &0 = \dot{m}_{in} - \dot{m}_{out}\\
    \mathrm{additional:} \, &0 = 1000 - \dot{m}_{in} (\cdot {h_{out} - h_{in}})

.. _tespy_module_convergence_label:

Convergence stability
+++++++++++++++++++++
One of the main downsides of the Newton-Raphson method is that the initial
step width is very large and that it does not know physical boundaries, for
example mass fractions smaller than 0 and larger than 1 or negative pressure.
Also, the large step width can adjust enthalpy or pressure to quantities that
are not covered by the fluid property databases. This would cause an inability
e.g. to calculate a temperature from pressure and enthalpy in the next
iteration of the algorithm. In order to improve convergence stability, we have
added a convergence check.

**The convergence check manipulates the system variables after the increment**
**has been added**. This manipulation has four steps, the first two are always
applied:

* Cut off fluid mass fractions smaller than 0 and larger than 1. This way a
  mass fraction of a single fluid component never exceeds oxygenthese boundaries.
* Check, whether the fluid properties of pure fluids are within the available
  ranges of CoolProp and readjust the values if not.

The next two steps are applied, if the user did not specify an
:code:`init_path` and the iteration count is lower than 3, thus in the first
three iteration steps of the algorithm only. In other cases this convergence
check is skipped.

* Fox mixtures: check, if the fluid properties (pressure, enthalpy and mass
  flow) are within the user specified boundaries
  (:code:`p_range, h_range, m_range`) and if not, cut off higher/lower values.
* Check the fluid properties of the connections based on the components they
  are connecting. For example, check if the pressure at the outlet of a turbine
  is lower than the pressure at the inlet or if the flue gas composition at a
  combustion chamber's outlet is within the range of a "typical" flue gas
  composition. If there are any violations, the corresponding variables are
  manipulated. If you want to look up, what exactly the convergence check for a
  specific component does, look out for the :code:`convergence_check` methods
  in the :py:mod:`tespy.components module <tespy.components>`.

.. tip::

    If your **system includes fluid mixtures**, you might want to
    **make use of the value ranges** for the system variables. This
    improves the stability of the algorithm. Try to fit the boundaries as tight
    as possible, for instance, if you know that the maximum pressure in the
    system will be at 10 bar, use it as upper boundary. Value ranges for pure
    fluids are not required as these are dealt with automatically.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> nw.set_attr(p_range=[0.05, 10], h_range=[15, 2000])
        >>> nw.units.default["pressure"]
        'bar'
        >>> [float(p) for p in nw.p_range_SI]
        [5000.0, 1000000.0]

In a lot of different tests the algorithm has found a near enough solution
after the third iteration, further checks are usually not required.

.. tip::

    To check if the solver successfully found a solution for your model you can
    check the `.status` attribute of the Network class after calling the
    `solve` method. It will be

    - 0 in case a solution was successfully found
    - 1 in case a solution was found, but some parameters violate physical
      limits
    - 2 in case no convergence was achieved after completion of the iterations
    - 3 in case a linear dependency in the Jacobian matrix is found
    - 11 in case the number of specified parameters is too small for the given
      problem
    - 12 in case the number of specified parameters is too large for the given
      problem
    - 99 in case the simulation crashed due to any other reason

    The :code:`solve` does not exit with an exception in case the status is
    0, 1, 2 or 3. If you want to raise an error in your script, you can call
    the `Network.assert_convergence()` method. It will raise an
    :code:`AssertionError` if the simulation did not find a converged solution
    status 2 or status 3.

Calculation speed improvement
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
For improvement of calculation speed, the calculation of specific derivatives
is skipped, if the change of the corresponding variable was below a
threshold of :code:`1e-12` in the iteration before.

As a user you can take two more measures to improve calculation speed: Specify
primary variables whenever possible/reasonable. This will not only reduce the
variable space but also remove the necessity to calculate partial derivatives
towards them.

.. _tespy_networks_debugging_label:

Debugging
+++++++++
In this section we show you how you can debug your models and list common
mistakes.

**Topology**

First, make sure your network topology is set up correctly, TESPy will prompt
an error, if it is not, and provide you with information, which components are
missing connections. Usually, this is the case, when you forgot to add the
connections to the network.

**Presolving**

In the first part of the presovling phase, the variable space reduction is
performed. TESPy will prompt errors, in case the parameter specifications in
context of the topology lead to an infeasibility in any of the variables. This
can be, for example

- a circular linear dependency between a set of variables. Typically, the mass
  flow can be over-determined by not including a :code:`CycleCloser` component
  in a ciruclar network. For example, ff you are modeling a cycle, e.g. the
  Clausius Rankine cylce, you need to make a cut in the cycle using the
  :code:`CycleCloser` or a :code:`Sink` and a :code:`Source` not to
  over-determine the system. Have a look in the
  :ref:`tutorial section <tespy_basics_label>` to understand why this is
  important and how it can be implemented.
- two parallel flows starting and ending in a common point (e.g. from a
  :code:`Splitter` to a :code:`Merge`) and both having linear specifications
  for the change of pressure from the start to the end. Then the common inflow
  and the common outflow pressure would be connected linearly through two
  different ways, which cannot be solved. One of both must be a result. Note:
  the same is of course true for a nonlinear dependency of pressure change, but
  this cannot be detected by the presolving.
- the values of two variables (or more) are directly specified in a set of
  linearly dependent variables. This does not need to be direct specification,
  it can also be indirect, through specifying temperature and vapor mass
  fraction in one location and specifying pressure in a different location
  while the specified pressure is linearly dependent to the pressure at the
  location with specified temperature and vapor mass fraction. In this case,
  the combination of temperature and vapor mass fraction determines the
  saturation pressure and therefore we end up with two pressure values fixed.

**Solving**

After the presolving is complete, a check will be carried out, if you specified
a sufficient number of parameters, meaning the exact number matching the
number of equations imposed to the problem. TESPy will prompt an error, if you
did not provide enough or if you provide too many parameters for your
calculation, but cannot provide information which specific variables are under-
or over-determined.

.. note::

    Always keep in mind, that the system has to find a value for mass flow,
    pressure, enthalpy and the fluid mass fractions. Try to build up your
    network step by step and have in mind, what parameters will be determined
    by adding a component without any parametrisation. This way, you can easily
    determine, which parameters are still to be specified.

To help you with debugging, you can use a couple of methods to inspect the
mathematical problem. To do this, you have to start the simulation with
:code:`init_only=True`. This can also be applied in case the number of
parameters passed to your problem is incorrect and you might be unsure why.
Then you can use the following methods to obtain information on your problem:

.. code-block:: python

    nw.solve("design", init_only=True)
    print(nw.get_presolved_variables())
    print(nw.get_presolved_equations())
    print(nw.get_variables())
    print(nw.get_equations())

- :code:`get_presolved_variables`: A list of all variables of the system, that
  have already been solved in the preprocessing. The list contains tuples of
  labels and attributes, e.g. :code:`("1", "p")` for the pressure of the
  connection with label "1".
- :code:`get_presolved_equations`: A list of equations of the system, that were
  applied to presolved the aforementioned variables. These come in a similar
  form as tuples, e.g. :code:`("3", "T")` for the temperature equation of the
  connection with label "3".
- :code:`get_variables`: A dictionary of the actual variables remaining for the
  solver to solve for. The keys of the dictionary are again tuples, with an
  index number and the variable type, e.g. :code:`(0, "h")` for a variable
  representing enthalpy. The values corresponding to each key are again a list,
  which show all of the variables the are representing, e.g.
  :code:`[("2", "h"), ("7", "h")]` in case the variable represents the enthalpy
  of the connections with the labels "2" and "7".
- :code:`get_equations`: A dictionary with the actual equations remaining for
  the solver to be solved after the presolving. The key is an integer index and
  the value is a tuple containing the label of the component or connection,
  from which the equation originates and a second tuple with the name of the
  constraint as well as an index (which is used, when one constraint comes
  with more than a single equation), e.g. :code:`("compressor", ("eta_s", 0))`
  for the first equation coming of the constraint "eta_s" of a component named
  "compressor".

These methods will help you in finding which of your specifications might be
the reason for over- order under-determination of the problem.

If you have the correct number of specifications and run the simulation, it
can still happen that the calculation crashes after or even before the first
iteration. There might be a couple of reasons for that:

- Sometimes, the fluid property database does not find a specific fluid
  property in the initialisation process, have you specified the values in the
  correct unit?
- A linear dependency in the Jacobian matrix due to bad parameter settings
  stops the calculation (over-determining one variable, while missing out on
  another).
- A linear dependency in the Jacobian matrix due to bad starting values stops
  the calculation.

The first reason can be eliminated by carefully choosing the parametrisation.
**A linear dependency due to bad starting values is often more difficult to**
**resolve, and it may require some experience.** Apart from over-determining
one variable while under-determinig another, typical reasons for a linear
dependency are mostly bad starting values in combination with equations that
require the **calculation of a temperature**, e.g. specifying a temperature at
some point of the network with unkown pressure, or terminal temperature
differences at heat exchangers, etc.. In this case, **the starting enthalpy **
**and pressure should be adjusted in a way, that the fluid's state is**
**within the expected region (liquid, two-phase or vapor).** Especially, in
case the linear dependency appears after some iterations, better starting
values often do the trick.

.. caution::

  When identifying a linear dependency, TESPy will prompt the equations that
  might be the reason for the linear dependency. This is still an experimental
  feature, so it might not always be correct. We would appreciate feedback,
  e.g. through the online user meetings or the github discussions page.

Another frequent error is that fluid properties move out of the bounds given by
the fluid property database. The calculation will stop immediately.
**Adjusting pressure and enthalpy ranges for the convergence check** might help
in this case.

.. note::

    If you experience slow convergence or instability within the convergence
    process, it is sometimes helpful to have a look at the iteration
    information. This is printed by default and provides information on the
    residuals of your systems' equations and on the increments of the systems'
    variables. Maybe it is only one variable causing the instability, its
    increment is much larger than the increment of the other variables?

Did you experience other errors frequently and have a workaround/tips for
resolving them? You are very welcome to contact us and share your experience

Post-processing
---------------
A post-processing is performed automatically after the calculation finished. You
have further options:

- Automatically create a documentation of your model.
- Print the results to prompt (:code:`print_results()`).
- Save the results in structure of .csv-files (:code:`save()`).
- Generate fluid property diagrams with an external tool.

Results printing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To print the results in your console use the :code:`print_results()` method.
It will print tables containing the component and connection properties.
Some results will be colored, the colored results indicate

* if a parameter was specified as value before calculation.
* if a parameter is out of its predefined value bounds (e.g. efficiency > 1).
* if a component parameter was set to :code:`'var'` in your calculation.

The color for each of those categories is different and might depend on the
console settings of your machine. If you do not want the results to be colored
you can instead call the method the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    my_plant.print_results(colored=False)

If you want to limit your printouts to a specific subset of components and
connections, you can specify the :code:`printout` parameter to block individual
result printout.

.. code-block:: python

    mycomp.set_attr(printout=False)
    myconn.set_attr(printout=False)

If you want to prevent all printouts of a subsystem, add something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    # connections
    for c in mysubsystem.conns.values():
        c.set_attr(printout=False)

    # components
    for c in mysubsystem.comps.values():
        c.set_attr(printout=False)

Save your results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you choose to save your results the specified folder will be created
containing information about the network, all connections and components.

In order to perform calculations based on your results, you can access all
components' and connections' parameters:

The easiest way to access the results of one specific component looks like this
(continuing at the initial example):

.. code:: python

    >>> round(compressor.eta_s.val, 2)  # isentropic efficiency of mycomp in network unit
    80.0
    >>> round(compressor.eta_s.val_SI, 2)  # isentropic efficiency of mycomp in SI unit
    0.8
    >>> round(compressor.P.val, 1)  # power of mycomp in network unit
    925.6
    >>> round(compressor.P.val_SI, 1)  # power of mycomp in SI unit
    690222.8
    >>> round(compressor.P.val_with_unit, 1)  # power as pint Quantity with unit and magnitude
    <Quantity(925.6, 'horsepower')>

and similar for connection parameters:

.. code:: python

    >>> round(c1.m.val, 1)  # value in specified network unit
    5.0
    >>> round(c1.m.val_SI, 1)  # value in SI unit
    5.0
    >>> round(c1.m.val_with_unit, 1)  # mass flow as pint Quantity with unit and magnitude
    <Quantity(5, 'kilogram / second')>
    >>> c1.fluid.val['air']  # mass fraction of air
    1.0

.. note::

    Mass fractions of the fluid composition are always SI values!

On top of that, you can access pandas DataFrames containing grouped results
for the components, connections and busses. The instance of class Network
provides a results dictionary.

.. code:: python

    # key for connections is 'Connection'
    results_for_conns = my_plant.results['Connection']
    # keys for components are the respective class name, e.g.
    results_for_turbines = my_plant.results['Turbine']
    results_for_heat_exchangers = my_plant.results['HeatExchanger']
    # keys for busses are the labels, e.g. a Bus labeled 'power input'
    results_for_mybus = my_plant.results['power input']

The index of the DataFrames is the connection's or component's label.

.. code:: python

    results_for_specific_conn = my_plant.results['Connection'].loc['myconn']
    results_for_specific_turbine = my_plant.results['Turbine'].loc['turbine 1']
    results_for_component_on_bus = my_plant.results['power input'].loc['turbine 1']

The full list of connection and component parameters can be obtained from the
respective API documentation.

Network reader
==============
The network reader is a useful tool to import networks from a data structure
using .csv-files. In order to re-import an exported TESPy network, you must
save the network first.

.. code:: python

    my_plant.export('mynetwork.json')

This exports a json file containing all relevant information defining your
network (general network information, components, connections, busses,
characteristics) holding the parametrisation of that network. You can re-import
the network using following code with the path to the saved document. The
generated network object contains the same information as a TESPy network
created by a python script.

.. code:: python

    from tespy.networks import Network
    imported_plant = Network.from_json('path/to/mynetwork.json')
    imported_plant.solve('design')

.. note::

    Imported busses, components and connections are accessible by their label,
    e.g. :code:`imported_plant.busses['total heat output']`,
    :code:`imported_plant.get_comp('condenser')` and
    :code:`imported_plant.get_conn('myconnectionlabel')` respectively. If
    you did not provide labels for your connections, by default, the
    connection's label will be according to this principle:
    :code:`'source-label:source-id_target-label:target-id'`, where source and
    target are the labels of the connected components.
