Online "Stammtisch"
===================
We have decided to start a reoccurring "Stammtisch" meeting for all interested
TESPy users and (potential) developers. You are invited to join us on every 3rd
Monday of a month at 17:00 CE(S)T for a casual get together. The first meeting
will be held at June, 20, 2022. The intent of this meeting is to establish a
more active and well connected network of TESPy users and developers.

If you are interested, you can simply join the meeting at
https://meet.jit.si/tespy_user_meeting. We are looking forward to seeing you!

User forum
==========
We have implemented a
`discussion room on GitHub <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/discussions>`__ as
user forum. If you have issues with setting up your model or any other question
about using the software, you are invited to start a discussion there.

In-person meetings
==================
Currently, no in-person meetings are scheduled. We will update this section, as
soon as a meeting is planned.
