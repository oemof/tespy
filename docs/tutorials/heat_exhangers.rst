Overview of Heat exchanger models
---------------------------------

This tutorial shows an overview of the different heat exchanger models
available in tespy. The table below indicates the different types and how they
compare in general. Further down the page we have created a problem, which
models the heat exchanger with a variety of the mentioned types and we show
the differences in the results.

.. note::

    - The accuracy depends on the context. In many context, the standard 0D
      heat exchanger components can be just as accurate as the 1D models.
    - The calculation speed also depends on context for the
      SectionedHeatExchanger:

      1. The number of specified sections is influencing the speed.
      2. If you impose :code:`td_pinch` or :code:`UA` to your model it will
         be significantly slower compared to other models, especially with a
         high number of sections.
      3. If you do not specify :code:`td_pinch` or :code:`UA` the sectioning is
         only applied once in the postprocessing, this takes more time than
         other types of heat exchangers but is still relatively fast.

Model comparisons
+++++++++++++++++

For the model comparison we have selected a typical problem: the condensation
of a working fluid in a heat pump to heat up water. The boundary conditions
are listed in the table below.

+---------------+----------------------+-------+------+
|     label     |    Specification     | value | unit |
+===============+======================+=======+======+
| c1            | fluid                | R290  | 1    |
+---------------+----------------------+-------+------+
|               | mass flow            | 5     | kg/s |
+---------------+----------------------+-------+------+
|               | dew line temperature | 60    | °C   |
+---------------+----------------------+-------+------+
|               | superheating         | 50    | °C   |
+---------------+----------------------+-------+------+
| c2            | subcooling           | 5     | °C   |
+---------------+----------------------+-------+------+
| d1            | fluid                | water | 1    |
+---------------+----------------------+-------+------+
|               | temperature          | 45    | °C   |
+---------------+----------------------+-------+------+
|               | pressure             | 1     | bar  |
+---------------+----------------------+-------+------+
| d2            | temperature          | 55    | °C   |
+---------------+----------------------+-------+------+
| heatexchanger | pressure drops       | 0     | bar  |
+---------------+----------------------+-------+------+

Given these boundary conditions, the following results can be obtained:

+--------------------------------+-------------------+-----------+-----------+
| type                           | minimum pinch (K) | kA (kW/K) | UA (kW/K) |
+================================+===================+===========+===========+
| HeatExchanger                  | n/a (10.0)        |  75.5     | n/a       |
+--------------------------------+-------------------+-----------+-----------+
| Condenser                      | n/a (5.0)         | 276.1     | n/a       |
+--------------------------------+-------------------+-----------+-----------+
| MovingBoundaryHeatExchanger    | 8.08              |  75.5     | 149.4     |
+--------------------------------+-------------------+-----------+-----------+
| SectionedHeatExchanger (50)    | 8.20              |  75.5     | 150.0     |
+--------------------------------+-------------------+-----------+-----------+
| SectionedHeatExchanger (6)     | 8.33              |  75.5     | 150.7     |
+--------------------------------+-------------------+-----------+-----------+

.. attention::

    Keep in mind: under different boundary conditions (e.g. no phase change)
    results of this comparison may vary a lot. There might be conditions, where
    the 0D components yield very similar results, or where deviation is even
    higher.

For the calculation of the results the following equations apply:

.. math::

    \Delta \theta_\text{log} = \frac{\Delta T_{i} - \Delta T_{i+1}}{\ln \frac{\Delta T_{i}}{\Delta T_{i+1}}}\\
    kA=\frac{\dot Q}{\Delta \theta_\text{log}}\\
    UA_{i}=\frac{\dot Q_{i}}{\Delta \theta_{\text{log,}i}}\\
    UA=\sum UA_{i}

For the calculation of :math:`kA` the terminal temperature differences
:code:`ttd_u` and :code:`ttd_l` are considered as the :math:`\Delta T_0` and
:math:`\Delta T_1`. For the calculation of UA, the internal temperature
differences :math:`\Delta T_{i}` are employed as highlighted in the figures
below.

We have created QT graphs to visualize the reason for the differences.

Condenser
^^^^^^^^^

In the condenser the upper terminal temperature differences is assigned to the
temperature differences between the dew line temperature of the condensing
fluid and the outlet temperature of the cold fluid.

MovingBoundary and Sectioned models
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Comparing these two models, we see almost identical results in the cases
shown above. However, this is not necessarily the case. There are situations,
where these models yield different results.

1. when specifying a different number of sections
2. with pressure losses along the flow
3. when there is curvature in the isobars (e.g. supercritical conditions near
   critical point)

Comparing different number of sections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For variant 1 the following graph shows the comparison of a 0D model to a
sectioned one.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For the variant 2 we can get differences in the results between the 1D models
when there is a pressure drop in the two-phase region.

in the supercritical region.
