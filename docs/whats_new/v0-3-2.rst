v0.3.2 - Carnot's Colors (June, 10, 2020)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New features
############
- Colored printouts are available in the :code:`print_results()` method of the
  network class. There are three different color codes available with default
  settings:

  - user specified parameters (:code:`'set'`, blue)
  - component parameters specified as variables (:code:`'var'`, green)
  - faulty parameters (:code:`'err'`, red)

  In order to change the colors, simply import :code:`coloring` from the
  :code:`tespy.tools.global_vars` module and adjust the escape codes. For
  example, to reset all colors to white text:

  .. code-block:: python

        from tespy.tools.global_vars import coloring
        coloring['set'] = '\033[0m'
        coloring['err'] = '\033[0m'
        coloring['var'] = '\033[0m'

  See `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors>`__ for a
  list of available codes
  (`PR #205 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/205>`_).

Bug fixes
#########
- Readd method for :code:`T_mix_ps` calculation for pure fluids: In case the
  fluid propagation did not go through (e.g. due to availability of good
  starting values) the fluid composition at a turbomachine's inlet and outlet
  may not be equal (`PR #207 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/207>`_).
- Fix the calculation of mixture density: The density is calculated as sum of
  the densities of the mixture components at their respective partial pressure
  and the mixture temperature
  (`PR #207 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/207>`_). With the old method,
  the specific volume was calculated according to Amagat's law, which produced
  incorrect values if one or more components of the mixture were liquid at the
  mixture's temperature and pressure. See discussion about humid air propreties
  here: `Issue #206 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/issues/206>`_.
