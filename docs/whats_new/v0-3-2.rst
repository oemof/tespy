v0.3.2 - Someversion (Somemonth, Someday, 2020)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New features
############
- Colored printouts are available in the :code:`print_results()` method of the
  network class. There are three different color codes available with default
  settings:

  - user specified parameters (:code:`'set'`, blue)
  - component parameters specified as variables (:code:`'var'`, green)
  - faulty parameters (:code:`'err'`, red)

  In order to change the colors, simply import :code:`coloring` from the
  :py:mod:`tespy.tools.global_vars` module and adjust the escape codes. For
  example, to reset all colors to white text:

  .. code-block:: python

        from tespy.tools.global_vars import coloring
        coloring['set'] = '\033[0m'
        coloring['err'] = '\033[0m'
        coloring['var'] = '\033[0m'

  See `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors>`_ for a
  list of available codes
  (`PR #205 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/205>`_).

Bug fixes
#########
- Readd method for :code:`T_mix_ps` calculation for pure fluids: In case the
  fluid propagation did not go through (e.g. due to availability of good
  starting values) the fluid composition at a turbomachine's inlet and outlet
  may not be equal (`PR #207 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/207>`_).
- Fix the calculation of mixture density. The density is calculated as sum of
  the densities of the mixture components at their respective partial pressure
  and the mixture temperature
  (`PR #207 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/207>`_).
