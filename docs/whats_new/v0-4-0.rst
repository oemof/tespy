API Changes
###########
- In order to stick closer to the
  `PEP 8 style guide <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ we changed
  the names of all classes in TESPy to :code:`CamelCase` instead of
  :code:`snake_case` as the latter is reserved for methods. This means, you
  need to change your import like in the following examples:

  .. code-block:: python

      from tespy.components import Turbine, CombustionEngine
      from tespy.components import HeatExchanger, HeatExchangerSimple
      from tespy.connections import Connection
      from tespy.connections import Bus
      from tespy.connections import Ref
      from tespy.networks import Network
      from tespy.tools.characteristics import CharLine

  The examples in the online documentation and the
  `examples <https://github.com/oemof/oemof-examples/tree/master/oemof_examples/tespy>`_
  repository have been adjusted accordingly
  (`PR #237 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/237>`_).
- The definition of power and heat transfer of the components
  :py:class:`tespy.components.combustion.combustion_engine.CombustionEngine`
  and :py:class:`tespy.components.customs.orc_evaporator.ORCEvaporator` as well
  as the heat loss values of the components
  :py:class:`tespy.components.heat_exchangers.solar_collector.SolarCollector`
  and
  :py:class:`tespy.components.heat_exchangers.parabolic_trough.ParabolicTrough`
  have been changed to negative sign as all values are energy output streams
  (`PR #215 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/215>`_) and
  (`PR #243 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/243>`_).
- Specification of characteristics has changed. Use a dictionary instead of
  DataContainer specification if you want to update more than just the
  characteristic function. E.g. if you have the measurement data for the
  isentropic efficiency of a turbine like below. X-data are ratio of actual
  mass flow to design mass flow and y values are the ratio of actual
  isentropic efficiency to design value of the turbine. Say, you want to
  specify these data as :py:class:`tespy.tools.characteristics.CharLine` and
  the characteristics should be applied. In order to do that, pass a dictionary
  that contains the :code:`CharLine` object as :code:`'char_func'` and set
  :code:`is_set` to :code:`True`:

  .. code-block:: python

      from tespy.components import Turbine
      from tespy.tools.characteristics import CharLine
      import numpy as np

      t = Turbine('myturbine')
      # ... design specs
      # ... design calculation
      # offdesign case, use char line
      line = CharLine(
        x=[0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1, 1.1],
        y=np.array([0.6, 0.65, 0.75, 0.82, 0.85, 0.855, 0.79]) / 0.855)
      t.set_attr(eta_s_char={'char_func': line, 'is_set': True})

  More information on characteristics specification and a fully working example
  can be found in the corresponding section in the online
  :ref:`documentation <component_characteristic_specification_label>`
  (`PR #243 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/243>`_).
- Characteristic Maps behave differently: Instead of two output dimensions
  :code:`z1` and :code:`z2` they do now only hold one output dimension
  :code:`z`. The calculation of z as function of x and y does not change
  (`PR #243 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/243>`_).
- The :code:`char_map` parameter of the component
  :py:class:`tespy.components.turbomachinery.compressor.Compressor` has been
  split up into two separate parameters:

  - :code:`char_map_eta_s`: Map linking non-dimensional mass flow and speed
    line to isentropic efficiency.
  - :code:`char_map_pr`: Map linking non-dimensional mass flow and speed line
    to pressure ratio.

  (`PR #243 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/243>`_).
- Remove class Node (`PR #243 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/243>`_).
- For reference specification, the :code:`delta` parameter must be specified
  in the corresponding network unit, e.g. if your pressure unit is set to
  :code:`bar`, the :code:`delta` will be interpreted in bar, too
  (`PR #243 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/243>`_).

New Features
############
- Automatic TESPy model documentation: You can generate an automatic model
  report in LaTeX format after a simulation. The document will contain all
  input parameters specified as well as all equations and characteristics
  applied in your previous simulation. Import and function call are implemented
  as follows. This feature will be under future development, driven by user
  requirements. If you have any feedback or suggestions or want to add new data
  you are very welcome to submit an issue in the GitHub repository or even open
  a pull request. The documentation code is located in the
  :py:mod:`tespy.tools.document_models` module.

  .. code-block:: python

      from tespy.tools import document_model

      document_model(mynetwork)

  For further information also check the corresponding section in the online
  documentation (`PR #243 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/243>`_).

- An automatic exergy analysis has been added. The method reliably works for
  temperature values that are larger than the ambient temperature. An
  implementation for temperature values crossing or below the ambient
  temperature is in the making. Also, combustion processes are not covered for
  now (`PR #215 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/215>`_). If you like to
  contribute, you are welcome to submit an issue in the GitHub repository.

- Add a method :code:`get_plotting_data` to each component to export the input
  data required by FluProDia in order to generate the data required to display
  state changes in the components in a fluid property diagram. Each component
  returns a nested dictionary containing the respective data. E.g. the return
  value of a :code:`valve`:

  .. code-block:: bash

      {1: {
          'isoline_property': 'h',
          'isoline_value': 773.8970004397456,
          'isoline_value_end': 773.8970004397456,
          'starting_point_property': 'p',
          'starting_point_value': 51.164150405253665,
          'ending_point_property': 'p',
          'ending_point_value': 6.831002318100345
     }}

  The diagrams could look like this:

  .. figure:: api/_images/logph_diagram_states.svg
      :align: center

      Figure: logph diagram of NH3 with a simple heat pump cycle.

  .. figure:: api/_images/Ts_diagram_states.svg
      :align: center

      Figure: Ts diagram of NH3 with a simple heat pump cycle.

  For more information see the respective
  :ref:`documentation section <FluProDia_label>`
  (`PR #234 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/234>`_).

- Add a flag to deactivate calculation of all component equations in every
  iteration. This improves stability in some cases but may reduce calculation
  speed (`PR #226 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/226>`_). To deactivate
  simply specify on calling the
  :py:meth:`tespy.networks.network.Network.solve` method:

  .. code-block:: python

      mynetwork.solve('design', always_all_equations=False)

- Add a flag use cuda instead of numpy for matrix inversion. With cuda matrix
  inversion is outsourced to the graphics card. Using cuda additionally
  requires :code:`cupy` installed on your machine
  (`PR #226 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/226>`_). To activate simply
  specify on calling the
  :py:meth:`tespy.networks.network.Network.solve` method:

  .. code-block:: python

      mynetwork.solve('design', use_cuda=True)

  For more information on :code:`cupy` visit the online
  `documentation <https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/index.html>`_.

  .. note::

      In general, calculation time depends on many factors of your local
      machine. You should try and check, if using cuda or disabling always all
      equations benefits your calculation times individually.

Documentation
#############
- Fix several broken links and typos
  (`PR #236 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/236>`_).

Bug Fixes
#########
- Fix a bug, where checking if parameters are numeric in the :code:`set_attr()`
  methods of classes connection, bus and component failed in case special numpy
  number types were passed
  (`#daa1ecb <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/commit/daa1ecb>`_,
  `#b420396 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/commit/b420396>`_).

.. list-table:: Adjust value limits for some component parameters
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - component
     - parameter
     - new value
   * - heat_exchanger_simple
     - :code:`zeta.max_val`
     - 1e15

     - 200
   * - valve
     - :code:`zeta.max_val`
     - 1e15

- On some machines the coloring of the results printout does not work and
  displaces the table in an ugly way. To avoid this, the coloring is changed to
  optional (`PR #229 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/229>`_). Use the
  following line for non-colored printouts:

  .. code-block:: python

      mynetwork.print_results(colored=False)

- An error message is raised in case the user specifies a fluid vector
  containing fluids, that are not part of the network's fluid list
  (`PR #233 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/233>`_).

- For improved convergence stability of the methods
  :py:meth:`tespy.components.heat_exchangers.heat_exchanger_simple.HeatExchangerSimple.kA_group_func` and
  :py:meth:`tespy.components.heat_exchangers.heat_exchanger_simple.HeatExchangerSimple.kA_char_group_func`,
  the logarithmic temperature difference is calculated based on the mean
  temperature difference between ambient and inlet and outlet temperature, if
  the terminal temperature differences do not have the same sign
  (`PR #225 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/225>`_).

- Changes in the equation management of components for much easier maintenance
  and future development
  (`PR #243 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/243>`_).
