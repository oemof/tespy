v0.7.2 - Under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Bug Fixes
#########
- The `delta` value of the :py:class:`tespy.connections.connection.Ref` class
  was oriented with the wrong sign. A positive delta lead to a negative value.
  Fixed in (`PR #459 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/459>`__).
- In initial simulations the temperature value of mixtures is 0 by default.
  For calculating temperatures of the mixtures during that initial simulation,
  that value was used as starting value causing CoolProp to raise an error and
  the calculation to crash. This is now prevented by checking if the starting
  value is reasonable or not
  (`PR #477 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/477>`__).
