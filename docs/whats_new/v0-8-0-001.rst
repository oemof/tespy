Fixes for v0.8.0
++++++++++++++++

Bug Fixes
#########
- A bug was fixed in CoolProp version 6.8.0
  `#2447 <https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/issues/2447>`__ for the S800
  fluid. The tests/examples affected by this in tespy have been updated
  (`PR #640 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/640>`__).
- In case a heat exchanger heats up the same mass flow (e.g. in a recuperator
  or internal heat exchanger), the derivative to the mass flow was assigned
  wrong (`PR #640 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/640>`__).

Other Changes
#############
- To improve convergence for offdesign calculation and problems with small
  initial increment of the variables the heuristics for the convergence check
  based on the components have been adjusted
  (`PR #641 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/641>`__).
- Update code, which was subject to be changed with the major release of 0.8.
