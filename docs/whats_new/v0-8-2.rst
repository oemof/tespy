v0.8.2 - Under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

API changes
###########
- The API of the :code:`Subsystem` class has been revised to make it act more
  like a :code:`Network`. You can get components and connections from the
  subsystem with respective methods, and the :code:`SubsystemInterface` class
  is utilized to target the :code:`subsystem.inlet` and
  :code:`subsystem.outlet` in a :code:`Connection` object. For the required
  changes please check the respective section
  :ref:`in the docs <tespy_subsystems_label>`
  (`PR #652 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/652>`__).
