v0.9.1 - Under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- A new component :code:`Pipeline` has been added, which can calculate heat
  losses based on its material, insulation as well as the surrounding
  conditions, e.g. if it is an above surface pipeline or a subsurface buried
  pipeline (`PR #661 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/661>`__).

Other Changes
#############
- A short description has been added to the :code:`SimpleHeatExchanger`
  docstrings on how to use the :code:`PowerConnection` in this context
  (`PR #705 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/705>`__).
