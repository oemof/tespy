- Physical exergy evaluation: Introduced a robust, domain-safe fallback for
  cases where CoolProp cannot evaluate ambient-state properties
  :code:`h(p0, T0)` or :code:`s(p0, T0)`. When the ambient temperature
  :code:`T0` is below the FluidPropertyWrapper's minimum supported temperature,
  TESPy now evaluates the reference state at the wrapper's :code:`Tmin` (offset
  by :code:`1e-6 K` to avoid boundary issues) and calculates the physical
  exergy with respect to that temperature without exergy splitting
  (`PR #828 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/828>`__).
