v0.9.11 - Under development
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Other changes
#############
- The documentation has been completely restructured to improve navigation. On
  top new tutorials on creating custom components and model debugging, a
  section on frequently asked questions and a more compact overview on the
  available component classes and the respective specification parameters with
  their underlying equations have been added
  (`PR #820 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/820>`__).

Bug Fixes
#########
- The moving boundary identification failed in some cases, when the phase
  change boundary was directly at the inlet or the outlet of a respective
  stream in the heat exchanger because brentq was to able to perform the root
  finding in that case
  (`PR #865 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/865>`__).
- With the change of the scaling of the variables in context of the calculation
  of numerical derivatives, the identification of minimum and maximum enthalpy
  limits is now working as expected again
  (`PR #867 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/867>`__).
