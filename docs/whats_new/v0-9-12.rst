v0.9.12 - Under development
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Other changes
#############
- The optimization API has changed to integrate :code:`pymoo` instead of
  :code:`PyGMO`. This change was done, because :code:`PyGMO` required conda to
  be installed on Windows, and the latest installable version available with
  pip for Linux based systems was broken.

  Very few changes have to be made to utilize :code:`pymoo` compared to the
  original implementation with :code:`PyGMO`, which only concern

  - specifying the population,
  - selecting the algorithm and
  - running the optimization.

  Old variant:

  .. code-block:: python

      algo = pg.algorithm(pg.ihs(gen=num_gen, seed=42))
      # create starting population
      pop = pg.population(pg.problem(optimize), size=num_ind, seed=42)

      optimize.run(algo, pop, num_ind, num_gen)

      results = optimize.individuals

  New variant:

  .. code-block:: python

      algorithm = DE(pop_size=20)

      res = minimize(
          problem,
          algorithm,
          termination=('n_gen', num_evo)
      )

      results = problem.log

  With the new implementation you also have more control on automatic
  termination of the optimization. For all information see the
  `pymoo docs <https://pymoo.org>`__, and check out the
  :ref:`tutorial <tespy_optimization_label>` to see, how to use :code:`pymoo`.

Bug Fixes
#########
- The starting points for fluid wrapper propagation now can handle classes that
  inherit from the starting point components. Before, they had to have the
  identical name because a class name comparison was done
  (`PR #871 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/871>`__).
