v0.9.13 - Under development
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- The :code:`Valve` class now has flow coefficient :code:`Kv` equations
  implemented. You can either specify the :code:`Kv` value directly, specify a
  :code:`Kv_char` with an :code:`opening` which does a value lookup of
  :code:`Kv` as function of the :code:`opening` or you can provide a custom
  function, which takes the :code:`opening` and a set of custom parameters that
  will be called by the equation
  (`PR #891 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/891>`__).
- It is now possible to dynamically add missing combustion fluids to your model
  by importing :code:`COMBUSTION_FLUIDS` from the :code:`tespy.tools` module
  and adding the respective information (fluid name, LHV and/or enthalpy of)
  formation . For an example check out the docs:
  :py:class:`tespy.components.combustion.base.CombustionChamber`
  (`PR #770 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/770>`__)
