v0.9.13 - Under development
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- The :code:`Valve` class now has flow coefficient :code:`Kv` equations
  implemented. You can either specify the :code:`Kv` value directly, specify a
  :code:`Kv_char` with an :code:`opening` which does a value lookup of
  :code:`Kv` as function of the :code:`opening` or you can provide a custom
  function, which takes the :code:`opening` and a set of custom parameters that
  will be called by the equation.
