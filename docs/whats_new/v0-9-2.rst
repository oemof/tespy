v0.9.2 - Kelvin's Kingdom (July, 24, 2025)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Other Changes
#############
- The generic starting values have been reworked to some extent (and as an
  interim solution). Through this, the guesses are more fluid agnostic and
  should work better for a larger variety of fluids, including incompressibles.
  An overall refactoring of this part of the presolver follow in the future
  (`PR #708 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/708>`__).

Bug Fixes
#########
- The :code:`Pump` convergence check now enforces liquid state in the first
  iterations (`PR #708 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/708>`__).
- The :code:`FutureWarningHandler` now passes through the warnings correctly
  to the logger without change the type of warning
  (`PR #712 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/712>`__).
- The :code:`_to_exerpy` export of the :code:`Network` instance was broken due
  to the change in the connector IDs for some components with the introduction
  of the :code:`PowerConnection` class
  (`PR #713 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/713>`__).
