v0.9.4 - under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- A new component :code:`Node` is available. The component combines the
  :code:`Splitter` and :code:`Merge` component in a single one, meaning you can
  connect multiple inlets and multiple outlets at the same time. The pressure
  is forced equal for all connections, the enthalpy and fluid composition will
  be equal for all of the outlets and based on the incoming fluids' states
  (`PR #733 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/733>`__).

Other Changes
#############
- A few broken internal links have been fixed in the documentation
  (`PR #735 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/735>`).
- An error is raised, when a Subsystem calls its :code:`add_conns` method and
  the label of the to be added connection is already existing inside the
  Subsystem (`PR #745 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/745>`).
