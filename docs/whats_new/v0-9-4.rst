v0.9.4 - under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

API Changes
###########
- The specification of units via the :code:`Network` class instance is
  deprecated and will be removed with the next major release. Use the new
  `tespy.units` module instead.
- In the back-end of the :code:`tespy.components` you have to adjust the
  access to component property values. Previously, these were accessed through
  the :code:`val` property of the respective object, e.g.

  - turbine efficiency: :code:`turbine.eta_s.val`
  - or heat exchanger heat :code:`heatexchanger.Q.val`

  With the introduction of units for all component parameters, these should now
  exclusively be accessed with the :code:`val_SI` property, which also aligns
  the API with the :code:`Connection` class API, e.g.:

  - turbine efficiency: :code:`turbine.eta_s.val_SI`
  - heat exchanger heat :code:`heatexchanger.Q.val_SI`

  The old way of access may still work if you are exclusively using SI units in
  your models, but may have unexpected side-effects.

  If you want to make use of the unit conversion capabilities yourself for
  custom components and their attributes, then you have to provide the
  :code:`quantity` information to the respective parameter. For more
  information on this, please check the
  :ref:`respective section <tespy_components_custom_components_label>` in the
  docs.

New Features
############
- A new component :code:`Node` is available. The component combines the
  :code:`Splitter` and :code:`Merge` component in a single one, meaning you can
  connect multiple inlets and multiple outlets at the same time. The pressure
  is forced equal for all connections, the enthalpy and fluid composition will
  be equal for all of the outlets and based on the incoming fluids' states
  (`PR #733 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/733>`__).
- TESPy now integrates `pint <https://pint.readthedocs.io/>`__ for unit
  conversions. With this change, you can now also specify units for the missing
  connection parameters

  - quality: :code:`x`,
  - temperature differences: :code:`Td_bp` and
  - power/heat :code:`E` for :code:`PowerConnections`

  as well as all component parameters. For an example on how to work with the
  new units, please check :ref:`this section <TODOADDSECTIONLABEL>`
  (`PR #743 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/743>`__).

Other Changes
#############
- A few broken internal links have been fixed in the documentation
  (`PR #735 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/735>`).
