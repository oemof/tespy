v0.9.4 - under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- A new component :code:`Node` is available. The component combines the
  :code:`Splitter` and :code:`Merge` component in a single one, meaning you can
  connect multiple inlets and multiple outlets at the same time. The pressure
  is forced equal for all connections, the enthalpy and fluid composition will
  be equal for all of the outlets and based on the incoming fluids' states
  (`PR #733 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/733>`__).
- A new component :code:`PolynomialCompressor` is available. The component
  uses `EN 12900` type polynomial coefficients to calculate isentropic and
  volumetric efficiencies, and can take dissipative heat loss into
  consideration. With the assumption, that these efficiencies do not change,
  the displacement in offdesign conditions can be calculated based on variable
  rpm of the compressor
  (`PR #741 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/741>`__).

Other Changes
#############
- A few broken internal links have been fixed in the documentation
  (`PR #735 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/735>`).
