v0.9.6 - Kelvin's Kingdom (September, 22, 2025)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############

- There is a new component :code:`ParallelFlowHeatExchanger` implementing
  parallel flow heat exchange, which works analogously to the
  counter current variant :code:`HeatExchanger`
  (`PR #766 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/766>`__).
- A partload UA modification is available for the
  :code:`MovingBoundaryHeatExchanger` class implementing the equation described
  in :cite:`cecchinato2010`
  (`PR #752 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/752>`__).

Bug Fixes
#########
- Calculation with humid air (water air mixtures) were broken for a state
  where partial pressure of the water exactly corresponds the saturation
  pressure at the given temperature of the mixture. Now there is an additional
  check in place to make sure the correct calculations are employed
  (`PR #774 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/774>`__).
- The caching for pint broke when the python version of an environment was
  changed. Now a :code:`__pint_cache__` is placed in the tespy installation
  folder, to which the :code:`cache_folder` of pint's :code:`UnitRegistry` is
  linked (`PR #777 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/777>`__).
