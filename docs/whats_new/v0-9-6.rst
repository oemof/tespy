v0.9.6 - Under Development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- There is a new component :code:`ParallelFlowHeatExchanger` implementing
  parallel flow heat exchange, which works analogously to the
  counter current variant :code:`HeatExchanger`
  (`PR #766 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/766>`__).

Bug Fixes
#########
- Calculation with humid air (water air mixtures) were broken for a state
  where partial pressure of the water exactly corresponds the saturation
  pressure at the given temperature of the mixture. Now there is an additional
  check in place to make sure the correct calculations are employed
  (`PR #774 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/774>`__).
