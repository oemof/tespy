v0.9.8 - Under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- It is now possible the specify pressure indirectly by specifying the dew line
  or bubble line temperature of the fluid :code:`T_dew` or :code:`T_bubble`.
  Specifying any of these will precalculate the pressure in the preprocessing
  and set it as fixed value on the respective connection
  (`PR #793 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/793>`__).

Bug Fixes
#########
- :code:`td_bubble` and :code:`td_dew` are now calculated in postprocessing if
  they are not specified
  (`PR #792 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/792>`__).
