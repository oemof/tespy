v0.9.8 - Under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- It is now possible the specify pressure indirectly by specifying the dew line
  or bubble line temperature of the fluid :code:`T_dew` or :code:`T_bubble`.
  Specifying any of these will precalculate the pressure in the preprocessing
  and set it as fixed value on the respective connection
  (`PR #793 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/793>`__).
- A new component :code:`SectionedHeatExchanger` is available. This component
  works similar to the :code:`MovingBoundaryHeatExchanger` but discretizes with
  a specific number of steps (user specified) over the enthalpy and linearly
  over the pressure drop. This allows you to integrate pressure drop in the UA
  and internal pinch calculation. For an example look up the component in the
  API documentation
  (`PR #794 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/794>`__).

Other changes
#############
- :code:`Q_diss_rel` of the :code:`PolynomialCompressor` class has been
  renamed to :code:`dissipation_ratio`
  (`PR #802 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/802>`__).


Bug Fixes
#########
- :code:`td_bubble` and :code:`td_dew` are now calculated in postprocessing if
  they are not specified
  (`PR #792 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/792>`__).
