v0.9.9 - Under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Other changes
#############
- The parsing/exporting a tespy model to exerpy has been included in the exerpy
  package in its latest release. Therefore the respective capabilities and
  methods are removed from tespy
  (`PR #729 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/729>`__).

Bug Fixes
#########
- Some component parameters were missing the quantity specification. This has
  been fixed (`PR #823 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/823>`__).
- Some component equations were utilizing the :code:`.val` property inside
  some equations, leading to false results when these properties were specified
  in non-SI units (`PR #832 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/832>`__).
